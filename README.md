# Language Models

> [!NOTE]  
> Google Gemini 2.0 Flash released https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/, Dec 11, 202

> [!NOTE]  
> Amazon has released its own suite of models per https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws Dec 3 2024
> 
> See https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/understanding/ for details.
> 

> [!TIP]  
>See https://artificialanalysis.ai/ for model comparisons.


## Fine Tune Model

Google https://aistudio.google.com/ is used as the model platform as it is the most accessible for new users, and is free to finetune.

> [!NOTE]  
> See https://cloud.google.com/ai/gemini for the difference between Google AIStudio and Google Vertex AI.

Google Gemini Flash is Finetuned.

> [!WARNING] Fine tuned models in https://aistudio.google.com/ have limitations
> 1. Do not currently support a System Prompt 
>     - a consideration if making the model accessible to others as a system prompt is one mitigation for prompt injection
> 2. Require OAuth to access and credentials must be renewed after 7 days. 
>     - a consideration if the model is to run continuously or for long periods.

500 CVEs is used as the initial Finetuning dataset.

>[!TIP] 
> If you already have a model and need to finetune it on your data, consider the inverse, where you should likely have ~0.000001Ã— the number of tokens as a minimum (10K tokens for a 1B parameter model). 
> 
> [LLMs in Production you own this product, From language models to successful products](https://www.manning.com/books/llms-in-production)
 
 So if Gemini 1.5 Flash is 32B (32B is a guess as it's not published AFAIK), then 
 - 32,000,000,000 * 0.000001 = 32000 tokens 
    - ~~ 24000 words (using 0.75 words per token)
      - ~~ 240 CVE Descriptions (using 100 words per CVE Description)
      - 500 is used as the minimum to fine-tune a model.

# Dataset

1. Create a **5** examples manually to use as Few Shot examples for a larger LLM (e.g. Claude Sonnet 3.5)
   1. review manually
2. Create ~**500** examples from the Few Shot examples (where 500 is a ~~ minimum required)
   1. review using an LLM, and manually
   2. Fine-Tune Gemini 1.5 Flash with 500 dataset
3. Create ~**5000** examples with the Fine-Tuned model
   1. review using an LLM, and manually
   2. The [dataset of 5216 samples](data_in/finetune_top25_KeyPhrase_WeaknessDescription_json.csv) was used to finetune the model.
4. Create ~**50000** examples with the Fine-Tuned model 
   1. review using an LLM, and manually
   2. Based on the review I did not Fine-Tune as the data was good enough
4. Create ~**250,000** (~~number of publisehd CVEs) examples with the Fine-Tuned model
   1. review using an LLM, and manually. **This is Work In Progress**
   1. Deploy to Production i.e. future published CVEs

Published CVEs were used as input data.



> [!TIP]  
> This dataset was built up from zero and validated using an LLM-as-a-judge in addition to manual review.

# Finetuning
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/tune
![Import](images/tune.png)

2. Click "Import" and select the [dataset of 5216 samples CSV](data_in/finetune_top25_KeyPhrase_WeaknessDescription_json.csv)
3. Select first column as Input 
4. Select second column as Output 
5. Click "Use first row as headers as the CSV has a heading row"

![Import](images/5216_samples.png)
6. Click "Import 5216 examples"
   
7. Give the model a name and description
8. Choose the base model
   > [!NOTE]  
   > Not all models are available for fine tuning.
![Import](images/import.png)

10. Click 'Advanced Settings'
![Import](images/choose_model.png)

11. The 'Advanced settings' can be left as is. 
    1.  The loss curve can be reviewed at the end of the finetuning.

12. Wait... approx 2.5 hours... for the finetuning to complete


![Import](images/tuned_results.png)

12. The loss curve reaches minimum at ~4.5 epochs.

# Model Focus
> [!TIP]
> "**There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.**" Thomas Sowell

The section below highlights the consequence of these trade-offs.

## keyphrases
The primary focus of the schema, dataset, model is these [keyphrases](https://www.cve.org/Resources/General/Key-Details-Phrasing.pdf): 
- "rootcause",
- "weakness",
- "impact",
- "vector",
- "attacker",

and less so these:
- "product",
- "version",
- "component"

The product, version, component keyphrases:
1. Are arrays at the same level in the schema. A schema focused on product, version, component keyphrases might have nesting to handle the reality of many versions of products and associated components e.g.
   1. version 
      1. product
         1. component
2. will be extracted correctly for most cases, but won't be for more complex cases. See some examples below of more complex, and less common product, version, component information.

####  [CVE-2018-0004](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0004)  

##### Decscription
A sustained sequence of different types of normal transit traffic can trigger a high CPU consumption denial of service condition in the Junos OS register and schedule software interrupt handler subsystem when a specific command is issued to the device. This affects one or more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3 technologies, the score is slightly higher. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) If the following entry exists in the RE message logs then this may indicate the issue is present. This entry may or may not appear when this issue occurs. /kernel: Expensive timeout(9) function: **Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D50; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D30; 12.3R versions prior to 12.3R12-S7; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D30, 14.1X53-D34; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D33, 15.1X53-D60.
