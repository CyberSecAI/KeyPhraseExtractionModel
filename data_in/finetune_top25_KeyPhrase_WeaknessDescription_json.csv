"yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library.

The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability.

"Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.","{""rootcause"": """", ""weakness"": ""heap buffer overflow"", ""impact"": ""segfault or some other malfunction"", ""vector"": ""octet-counted framing"", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Rsyslog"", ""version"": """", ""component"": ""Modules for TCP syslog reception""}"

A heap out-of-bounds memory write exists in FFMPEG since version 5.1. The size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through all entries in the loop and adds `sc->ctts_data[i].count` to `sc->sample_offsets_count`. This can lead to an integer overflow resulting in a small allocation with `av_calloc()`. An attacker can cause remote code execution via a malicious mp4 file.

Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

"Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX–supported processors.

LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.,"{""rootcause"": ""improper size validation"", ""weakness"": ""out-of-bounds write"", ""impact"": ""denial of service"", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""LoRaMac-node"", ""version"": ""prior to 4.7.0"", ""component"": ""ProcessRadioRxDone function""}"

"Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.","{""rootcause"": """", ""weakness"": ""out of bounds reads/writes"", ""impact"": """", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Wasmtime"", ""version"": ""prior to 2.0.2"", ""component"": ""pooling instance allocator""}"

A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data.

"A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack.

"Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.","{""rootcause"": ""integer truncation"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": """", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Oxenstored"", ""version"": """", ""component"": """"}"
"x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot guests, Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would remain allocated.","{""rootcause"": ""use-after-free"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": """", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": ""physically proximate attacker"", ""product"": ""Xen"", ""version"": """", ""component"": ""shadow mode""}"

"The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable, which, if tampered with, may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix, we added an upper bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify it as a ""low-priority but useful improvement"". SystemDS is a distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular case though, the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns, which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly improved with almost zero overhead.

"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6.

"Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory.

"JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability.

"Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.","{""rootcause"": [""path traversal bug"", ""improper access control bug""], ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""leak sensitive files"", ""vector"": ""API request"", ""attacker"": ""malicious user"", ""product"": ""Argo CD"", ""version"": ""starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11 2.2.6 and 2.3.0"", ""component"": ""repo-server""}"

"Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes ""ok"" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write ""ok"" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.","{""rootcause"": ""Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""corrupt one file"", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": ""attacker"", ""product"": ""Cargo"", ""version"": """", ""component"": """"}"

"JOSE is ""JSON Web Almost Everything"" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS with no dependencies using runtime's native crypto in Node.js, Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their required library version, they have two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header Parameter).","{""rootcause"": ""insufficient input validation"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""consume unreasonable amount of CPU time"", ""vector"": ""extremely high PBES2 Count value"", ""attacker"": ""adversary"", ""product"": ""JOSE"", ""version"": ""before v1.28.2, v2.0.6, v3.20.4, and v4.9.2"", ""component"": ""PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms""}"

Specifically, these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin' parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin' parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver. Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However, given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code, any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept).

"Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensible operational monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.","{""rootcause"": """", ""weakness"": ""command injection"", ""impact"": ""execute arbitrary code"", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": ""unauthenticated user"", ""product"": ""Cacti"", ""version"": ""affected versions"", ""component"": ""remote_agent.php""}"

"Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method ""File.createTempFile"" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions ""-rw-r--r--"". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's ""AbstractDiskHttpData"" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own ""java.io.tmpdir"" when you start the JVM or use ""DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)"" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.","{""rootcause"": ""insecure temp file"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""local information disclosure"", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Netty"", ""version"": ""before 4.1.59.Final"", ""component"": ""multipart decoders""}"

"An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form.

According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.","{""rootcause"": ""weak credential hashing scheme"", ""weakness"": ""broken or risky cryptographic algorithm"", ""impact"": [""authentication bypass"", ""unauthorized access""], ""vector"": ""S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication"", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD"", ""version"": ""through 2022-05-06"", ""component"": ""S-Bus""}"

An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself.

"Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager (SM and FSC) through 2022-05-06 has Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity. According to FSCT-2022-0053, there is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager insufficient logic security controls issue. The affected components are characterized as: Honeywell FSC runtime (FSC-CPU, QPP), Honeywell Safety Builder. The potential impact is: Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service. The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager family of safety controllers utilize the unauthenticated Safety Builder protocol (FSCT-2022-0051) for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the controller. Control logic is downloaded to the controller on a block-by-block basis. The logic that is downloaded consists of FLD code compiled to native machine code for the CPU module (which applies to both the Safety Manager and FSC families). Since this logic does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, it allows an attacker capable of triggering a logic download to execute arbitrary machine code on the controller's CPU module in the context of the runtime. While the researchers could not verify this in detail, the researchers believe that the microprocessor underpinning the FSC and Safety Manager CPU modules is incapable of offering memory protection or privilege separation capabilities which would give an attacker full control of the CPU module. There is no authentication on control logic downloaded to the controller. Memory protection and privilege separation capabilities for the runtime are possibly lacking. The researchers confirmed the issues in question on Safety Manager R145.1 and R152.2 but suspect the issue affects all FSC and SM controllers and associated Safety Builder versions regardless of software or firmware revision. An attacker who can communicate with a Safety Manager controller via the Safety Builder protocol can execute arbitrary code without restrictions on the CPU module, allowing for covert manipulation of control operations and implanting capabilities similar to the TRITON malware (MITRE ATT&CK software ID S1009). A mitigating factor with regards to some, but not all, of the above functionality is that these require the Safety Manager physical keyswitch to be in the right position.","{""rootcause"": ""insufficient verification of data authenticity"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": [""remote code execution"", ""denial of service""], ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager"", ""version"": ""through 2022-05-06"", ""component"": """"}"

In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.","{""rootcause"": ""inadequate verification of user access"", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""access to resources beyond those configured"", ""vector"": ""proxy-like command"", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""ArchiSteamFarm"", ""version"": ""V5.2.2.2"", ""component"": """"}"

"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7.

"Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor.

This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state.

"indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a particular release.","{""rootcause"": """", ""weakness"": """", ""impact"": ""max out number of client connections"", ""vector"": """", ""attacker"": """", ""product"": ""indy-node"", ""version"": """", ""component"": """"}"
